                    <p>Hi! I am Ilya Netkach, a professional violinist from Ukraine.</p>
                        <p>I graduated from Kharkov State College of Music (2006) with a formal classical education. However, I was keen to acquire improvisation skills – jazz in particular – and soon started attending jazz jams and playing gigs, both solo and as a session musician.</p>
                        <p>In 2009, inspired by an interview of Steve Vai in Guitar World, about his first solo release “Flex-Able”, as well as by the music of Stephane Grappelli, Regina Carter, Jean-Luc Ponty, Eric Truffaz and others, I began working on my own original music. </p>
                           <p> My debut single, “Lugsana”, was released in December 2012.</p>
                        <p>Since 2013, I have been working in the Middle East as a teacher of music. I continue to compose and release my music, as well as play occasional gigs.<br>
                        In May 2016, with my band, I won first place in the Battle of the Bands at the Hard Rock Cafe Bahrain.<br>
                        My EP “I Am” (2017) received positive reviews from “All About Jazz” and “Smooth & Soul”.</p>
                        <p>I compose and release original violin music fully on my own, occasionally collaborating with my musician friends.  I handle all the production, bookings and promos by myself; I have no label, sponsors, etc. so it is an entirely DIY project.<br>
                        Even this website is completely brewed by me )</p>
                        <p>Currently, I'm based in Al Ain, UAE, where I work as Violin and Music Theory Teacher.
